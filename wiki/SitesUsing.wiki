= Sites using django-profile = 

Only me for the moment. :) I'm using this project on a production-ready site, with no modifications. I mean, the code used in this project is exactly the same used on the site. Only 1 personalized template has been modified. This is the site:

 * [http://gameocracy.org]

And there's the demo application too:
 
 * [http://profile.coredump.es]

If you're using django-profile in a project, please tell me and I will add your website to this list.
