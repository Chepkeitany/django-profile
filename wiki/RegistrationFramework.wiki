== Introduction ==

Registration is one of the most importants parts of a social website. Once an anonymous user accepts to register to our site, he must find the most easy method to do it. This part of the project aims to accomplish this task.

This is an screenshot of the actual demo version. It has no design, but you can see clearly what can be done:

== Detail ==

In the registration form, we ask the user for 2 fields of information: username and a password. Whenever the user inserts data, it will be checked internally (with Ajax) warning the user when something is wrong. All of these trying to make the user data introduction the less painful possible.

When all the information is correct the user will be automatically created in the system.
